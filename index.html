                    <h2 class="subheader" id="section-1">Why Venus?</h2>
                    <h3>A hellish wasteland</h3>
                    <p>The surface of Venus is extremely uninhabitable. The atmosphere mainly 
                        consists of poisonous carbon dioxide. Temperatures at the equator average 
                        around 450°C, which is hot enough to melt lead, and the atmospheric pressure 
                        is 96 bar, or equivalent to 1km underwater on Earth. A thick cloud layer 
                        makes sunlight scarce and the clouds themselves are made of sulfuric acid.</p>
                    <h3>Above the clouds</h3>
                    <p>However, as NASA engineer Geoffrey A. Landis observed in his 2003 paper 
                        <cite>Colonization of Venus</cite>, 50km above the surface Venus is the most 
                        earthlike place in the Solar System besides the Earth itself. 
                        <ul><li>Temperatures range from 0-75°C and pressure is close to 1 bar.</li> 
                        <li>Since 50km is above the cloud layer, solar energy is abundant.</li>
                        <li>The atmosphere is still thick enough at this altitude to provide protection from cosmic rays equivalent to 
                        Earth's atmosphere at sea level.</li>
                        <li>Gravity on Venus is about 90% of Earth's, which could prevent bone loss and other health problems associated 
                        with microgravity.</li>
                    </ul></p>
                    <p>On this page we will summarize the work of Landis and subsequent findings by
                        NASA on the long term feasibility of exploring and settling Venus.

                    <h2 class="subheader" id="section-2">Pre-colonization</h2>
                    <p>Studying Venus' runaway greenhouse effect may help us understand how to prevent the
                        Earth from becoming like it. <!--EXPAND-->
                    </p>
                    <p>Crewed exploration could begin with a design similar to Nasa's High Altitude Venus 
                        Operational Concept, or <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20160006580">HAVOC</a> 
                        for short. This would be a thirty-day mission aboard a blimp-like craft, 
                        testing the various systems and maneuvers required to maintain a habitat long-term.
                        The craft would be solar-powered and coated in Teflon to protect it from sulfuric 
                        acid aerosol droplets.</p>
                    <p class="highlight">If a more permanent presence is established in the atmosphere, it could be a more 
                        practical location from which to operate <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.nasa.gov/directorates/spacetech/niac/2012_phase_I_fellows_landis.html">
                        surface-exploring robots</a> than one in orbit. In addition to the advantages discussed above, 
                        signals would take less time to travel between the habitat and robots on the surface, 
                        allowing near real-time monitoring and control.</p>

                    <h3>Cities in the sky</h3>
                    <p>Thanks to the relatively high density of its mostly carbon-dioxide atmosphere, 
                        a breathable air mixture of nitrogen and oxygen is a lifting gas on Venus. 
                        This means that the full volume of an aerostat can be used as a habitat. 
                        In fact, the lifting force of air on Venus is so great that a city-sized 
                        volume of it can lift a city. Such a city would float at about an altitude 
                        of 50km, where temperatures stay around 75°C. A seperate volume 
                        filled with a lighter gas like hydrogen could be used to lift habitats 5km 
                        higher, where temperatures average a pleasant 27°C (Wikipedia contributors, "Colonization of Venus"). 
                        In either case, air pressure inside such a habitat would be nearly equal to 
                        its surroundings, so ruptures would result in slow leaks rather than the 
                        explosive decompression that would occur in space or on Mars.</p>
                    <h3>Sustaining a colony</h3>
                    <p>Although free oxygen and water are virtually nonexistent on Venus, the materials
                        needed to sustain a colony exist there in abundance in forms future colonists can 
                        unlock with sufficient energy. <ul><li>Electrolysis of sulfuric acid and carbon dioxide 
                        can provide water and oxygen respectively.</li> <li>Carbon dioxide and nitrogen captured 
                        from the atmosphere can also be used to grow plants which in turn would provide 
                        more oxygen and food.</li> <li>Ore for construction and industry can be mined from the 
                        surface with robots and sent to the colony with aircraft or high-temperature 
                        fullerene tethers.</li></ul></p>
                    <p class="highlight">While the rotational period of Venus is 243 Earth days, much of its atmosphere 
                        rotates significantly faster than the planet itself. An atmospheric habitat 
                        untethered to the surface would thus travel around the planet in about four 
                        Earth days, creating a slow but still-reasonable day/night cycle.</p>
                    <h3>Asteroid mining</h3>
                    <p>In the long term, an outpost on Venus could be used to reach asteroids more 
                        quickly than launching missions from Earth, Mars, or even the asteroid belt 
                        itself. This is due to Venus' relatively fast orbital velocity, giving craft 
                        launched from Venus a greater starting velocity as well as increasing the 
                        number of chances a craft has to enter a transfer orbit to anywhere in the 
                        asteroid belt.</p>
