            <h2>Why Venus?</h2>
                <h3>A hellish wasteland</h3>
                <p>The surface of Venus is extremely uninhabitable. The atmosphere mainly 
                    consists of poisonous carbon dioxide. Temperatures at the equator average 
                    around 450째C, which is hot enough to melt lead, and the atmospheric pressure 
                    is 96 bar, or equivalent to 1km underwater on Earth. A thick cloud layer 
                    makes sunlight scarce and the clouds themselves are made of sulfuric acid.</p>
                <h3>Above the clouds</h3>
                <p>However, at an altitude roughly 50km above the surface, Venus is the most 
                    earthlike place in the Solar System besides the Earth itself. Temperatures 
                    there range from 0-75째C and pressure is close to 1 bar. Since 50km is above 
                    the cloud layer, solar energy is abundant, yet the atmosphere is still thick 
                    enough at this altitude to provide protection from cosmic rays equivalent to 
                    Earth's atmosphere at sea level. Finally, gravity on Venus is about 90% of 
                    Earth's, which could prevent bone loss and other health problems associated 
                    with microgravity.</p>

                <h2>Scientific exploration</h2>
                <p>Early exploration could begin with a design similar to Nasa's High Altitude Venus 
                    Operational Concept, or <a href="https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20160006580">HAVOC</a> 
                    for short. This would be a thirty-day crewed mission aboard a blimp-like craft, 
                    testing the various systems and maneuvers required to maintain a habitat long-term.</p>
                <p>If a more permanent presence is established in the atmosphere, it could be a more 
                    practical location from which to operate <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/directorates/spacetech/niac/2012_phase_I_fellows_landis.html">
                    surface-exploring robots</a> than one in orbit. In addition to the advantages discussed above, signals would take less time to travel 
                    between the habitat and robots on the surface.</p>

            <section>
            <h2>Habitat design</h2>
            <h3>Cities in the sky</h3>
                <p>Thanks to the relatively high density of its mostly carbon-dioxide atmosphere, 
                    a breathable air mixture of nitrogen and oxygen is a lifting gas on Venus. 
                    This means that the full volume of an aerostat can be used as a habitat that 
                    will stay at an altitude of about 50km, where temperatures stay at a manageable 
                    75째C. A seperate volume filled with a lighter gas like hydrogen can be used 
                    to lift habitats 5km higher, where temperatures average a pleasant 27째C.</p>
                <p>Since the air pressure inside such a habitat would be about equal to its 
                    surroundings, ruptures would result in leaks rather than the explosive 
                    decompression that would occur in space or on Mars.</p>
                <p>Exterior surfaces can be coated with teflon to protect them from sulfuric 
                    acid aerosol droplets.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
            <h3>Sustaining a colony</h3>
                <p>Although free oxygen and water are virtually nonexistent on Venus, the ingredients 
                    for life as we know it exist there in abundance in forms future colonists can 
                    unlock with sufficient energy. Electrolysis of sulfuric acid and carbon dioxide 
                    can provide water and oxygen respectively. Carbon dioxide and nitrogen can also be 
                    used to grow plants which in turn would provide more oxygen and food.</p>
                <p>While the rotational period of Venus is 243 Earth days, much of its atmosphere 
                    rotates significantly faster near the equator. An atmospheric habitat untethered 
                    to the surface would thus travel around the planet in about four Earth days, 
                    creating a slow but still-reasonable day/night cycle.</p>
